    * Responsible for directly modifying the transform of entities. This system should
    * be the only system that can directly write to a transform component.
    * Runs at a fixed tick rate.
    *
    * During an update at t_i, the physics system performs 3 main tasks in order.
    * 1. If the entity has a movement intent component, process it and
    * update the physics component (dynamics state) of the entity
    * 2. Write the position of the entity at t_i (which was calculated last tick)
    * to the transform component
    * 3. Use the information in the physics component and the transform component
    * to find the position of the entity at t_(i+1) and store it
    *
    * In step 3, verlet integration is used to find the tentative position of
    * an entity at t_(i+1). Then, a binary BVH is constructed to resolve
    * penetrations based on this tentative position.
    * The BVH is then updated, then collision queries are answered.
